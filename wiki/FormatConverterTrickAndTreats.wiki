  * Reduce the number of models for testing (courtesy of Wim)
    In python/recoord2/msd/linkNmrStarData.py just set the numModelsToRead variable inside the LinkNmrStarData
class. This could be useful for quicker testing (set it to 1 temporarily). For 1cjg with 11 models this improved the processing speed from 3'45 to 1'58 on the macbook pro Stella just playing some Doe Maar in the background. Not a huge improvement but everything helps.

  * Limit processing to all but the final write of the NMR-STAR file. (courtesy of Wim)
    > ...  to test the conversion itself, I've now added a '-noWrite' option that you can pass into the [python/recoord2/msd/linkNmrStarData.py] script. The final NMR-STAR file will not be written, and should speed things up considerably when testing the conversion stage (the .summary file will still be generated).
    In the NRG setup this can be passed by changing setting:
{{{
    set extraFCOptions      = ( -raise -force )
    to:
    set extraFCOptions      = ( -raise -force -noWrite )
}}}
    For 1cjg with 1 model this improved the processing speed further from 1'58 to 1'48 on the macbook pro Stella now playing some Iron Maiden. So this seems to be a minor improvement.
