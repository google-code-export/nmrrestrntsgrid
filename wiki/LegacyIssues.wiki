#LegacyIssues

= Introduction =

This page describes some of the legacy issues with the code. It has gone from reading 'old' NMR-STAR files and 'old' PDB files to 3.1 NMR-STAR with remediated PDB files, then joined NMR-STAR files containing both the constraints and the information from mmCIF. Because there are differences in chain and/or sequence codes in all these formats, and other slight differences in the way the information is stored, some complex code changes had to be made to handle this progression (the code still had to work with the previous setup while testing the new one).

= Current issues =

 * The chain and/or sequence numbering in author tags of the coordinate section of the joined NMR-STAR file can be different from the actual sequence numbering. This is because of differences in the mmCIF and remediated PDB file (see issue 102).
 * The sequence can be longer than the information found in the coordinate section. This problem should now be fixed when this happens at the N-terminus of a sequence, but it might still be an issue if it happens at the C-terminus.
 * In CCPN, the internal NMR-STAR sequence numbering corresponds to seqId numbering, while the PDB author codes correspond to seqCode numbering. Because the seqCodes are used to match up the sequence to the NMR constraint data, any problems with setting these correctly (because of the above) can result in mismatches.
