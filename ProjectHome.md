The NMR Restraints Grid contains the original NMR data as collected for over 4,000 protein and nucleic acid structures with corresponding PDB entries. In addition to the original restraints, most of the distance, dihedral angle and RDC restraint data (>85%) were parsed, and those in over 500 entries were converted and filtered. The converted and filtered data sets constitute the DOCR and FRED databases respectively as described in these
