# These data are taken from the Database of Converted Restraints (DOCR). The 
# DOCR database was created from PDB coordinate and MR files. The DOCR data 
# adhere to the NMR-STAR "developmental version 3" dictionary.
# 
# Created using the CCPN FormatConverter software developed by Wim Vranken in 
# the MSD group at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). See 
# http://www.ccpn.ac.uk for more information on this software and the CCPN 
# project.

# The parsed BMRB files used as input were generated by Wattos as detailed in: 
# JF Doreleijers, S Mading, D Maziuk, K Sojourner, L Yin, J Zhu, JL Markley, and
# EL Ulrich. BioMagResBank database with sets of experimental NMR constraints 
# corresponding to the structures of over 1400 biomolecules deposited in the 
# Protein Data Bank. J.Biomol.NMR 26 (2):139-146, 2003.
