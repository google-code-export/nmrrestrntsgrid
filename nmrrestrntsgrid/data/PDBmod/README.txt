1ag7,Deleted duplicate atom, problem is fixed in mmCIF files. 
1aou,See 1ag7?
1cld,Removed the hetatm from end because they would otherwise hang off the last model only. When done correctly they should have been moved to their individual models.
1quz,See 1ag7.
2new,Renumbered model records. The data is split over 2 entries and models 1-18 are in 1new. Numbering started at 19 here. 
1ctl,Removed empty model 0. Fixed by Zukang too.
1f22,Added Chain id to last 2 lines because probably cut'npaste error. Other models contained them. Asked PDB folk to add them 7/19/2006. Was an old version; they already updated.
