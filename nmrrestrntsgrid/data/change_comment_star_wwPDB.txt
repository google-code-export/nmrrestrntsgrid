# This wwPDB archive file contains, for PDB entry <PDBCODE HERE>:
# 
# - Coordinates and sequence information from the PDB mmCIF file
# - NMR restraints from the PDB MR file
# 
# In this file, the coordinates and NMR restraints share the same atom names,
# and in this way can differ from the data deposited at the wwPDB. To achieve
# this aim, the NMR restraints were parsed from their original format files, and
# the coordinates and NMR restraints information were subsequently harmonized.
# 
# Due to the complexity of this harmonization process, minor modifications could
# have occurred to the NMR restraints information, or data could have been lost
# because of parsing or conversion errors. The PDB file remains the
# authoritative reference for the atomic coordinates and the originally deposited
# restraints files remain the primary reference for these data.
# 
# This file is generated as part of the wwPDB at the BioMagResBank (BMRB) in
# collaboration with the PDBe (formerly MSD) group at the European
# Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the CMBI/IMM group at the Radboud
# University of Nijmegen.
# 
# Several software packages were used to produce this file:
# 
# - Wattos (BMRB and CMBI/IMM).
# - FormatConverter and NMRStarExport (PDBe).
# - CCPN framework (http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/).
