# This NMR-STAR file contains, for PDB entry <PDBCODE HERE>:
# 
# - Coordinate and sequence from the PDB mmCIF file.
# - NMR restraint from the PDB MR file.
# 
# In this file, the coordinates and NMR restraints share the same atom names,
# and in this way differ from the data deposited at the wwPDB. To achieve this
# aim, the NMR restraints were parsed from their original format files, and the
# coordinate and NMR restraints information was subsequently harmonized.
# 
# Due to the complexity of this harmonization process, minor modifications could
# have occurred to the coordinate and/or NMR restraints information, or data
# could have been partially lost due to parsing or conversion errors. The PDB
# file therefore, remains the authoritative reference for the coordinate data,
# and the MR files remain the primary reference for the NMR restraint data.
# 
# These files are generated as part of the wwPDB at the BioMagResBank (BMRB) in
# collaboration with the MSD group at the European Bioinformatics Institute
# (EBI) and the CMBI/IMM group at the Radboud University of Nijmegen.
# 
# Several software packages were used to produce this file:
# 
# - Wattos (Jurgen Doreleijers, formerly BMRB now at CMBI/IMM).
# - FormatConverter (Wim Vranken, MSD).
# - CCPN framework (http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/)
# - NmrStarExport (Chris Penkett, MSD).
