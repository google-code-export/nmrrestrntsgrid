# This FRED archive file contains, for PDB entry <PDBCODE HERE>:
# 
# - Coordinates and sequence information from the PDB mmCIF file
# - NMR restraints from the PDB MR file
# 
# In this file, the coordinates and NMR restraints share the same atom names,
# and in this way can differ from the data deposited at the wwPDB. To achieve
# this aim, the NMR restraints were parsed from their original format files, and
# the coordinates and NMR restraints information were subsequently harmonized.
# 
# Due to the complexity of this harmonization process and the filtering process
# used in creating these files, the NMR restraints information in these files
# may differ significantly from that in the originally deposited file. Other 
# modifications could have occurred to the NMR restraints information, or data 
# could have been lost because of parsing or conversion errors. The PDB file 
# remains the authoritative reference for the atomic coordinates and the 
# originally deposited restraints files remain the primary reference for these 
# data.
# 
# This file is generated at the BioMagResBank (BMRB) in collaboration with the 
# PDBe (formerly MSD) group at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and 
# the CMBI/IMM group at the Radboud University of Nijmegen.
# 
# Several software packages were used to produce this file:
# 
# - Wattos (BMRB and CMBI/IMM).
# - FormatConverter and NMRStarExport (PDBe).
# - CCPN framework (http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/).
