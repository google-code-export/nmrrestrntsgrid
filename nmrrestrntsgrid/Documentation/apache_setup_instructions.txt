* apache on mac
    There's one in eclipse but heck why not shrew up the one in mac os integrated.
    On leopard which has apache 2:
        /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf and
        /private/etc/apache2/users/jd.conf


    Logs:
        tail -f /private/var/log/apache2/*_log &

    CGI stuff (not needed for nmrrestrntsgrid project):
        /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/

    Test:
        apachectl configtest

    Restart:
        /usr/sbin/httpd -k restart

    Install /Library/WebServer/Documents/favicon.ico

    In the System Preference of the Mac
        Sharing
            Turn on "Web Sharing" and check server in browser.

    For working together with tomcat see tomcat instructions in the same dir as this doc.


* apache on tang (solarix):
    * /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf                    configuration file (cc-ed to system settings)
    *   Perhaps not needed anymore but do:
        cd /var/www/html
        ln -s ../wattos .
    * /var/www/servlet_data                         data
        lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           19 Nov 22 12:01 molgrap -> /pdbmirror2/molgrap/
        lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           41 Nov 22 12:01 pdb -> /pdbmirror2/nozip/data/structures/all/pdb/
        lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           52 Nov 22 11:54 pdbmr -> /pdbmirror2/nozip/data/structures/all/nmr_restraints/
    * /etc/init.d/httpd restart
        The startup is automated (and tested) to start under run level 3,4, and 5
        and killed on levels 0,1,2 and 6 (restart)
        through invocation in /etc/rc.d:
        Apache starts before tomcat and stops after tomcat stops although that's not essential.
    * The location and format of the access logfile (Common Logfile Format).
        ErrorLog "| /usr/sbin/rotatelogs /var/log/httpd/error_log.%Y.%W 604800"
        Used to be:
        CustomLog "| /usr/sbin/rotatelogs /bmrb/admin/logs/tang/apache/access_log.%Y.%W 604800" combined
    * a notpub on port 8675 is used for temporary data exchange.
        but logs will show it.
    * Aqua web server and home page of jurgen are served by this apache.
    * cd /var/www/html;cp /bmrb/htdocs/favicon.ico .;touch robots.txt
        see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon
    * Redirect main apache server by adding main index.html:
        <html> <head> <meta HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" content="0; url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/~jurgen"> </head> </html>

* The webmodule URLs "www.bmrb." gets redirected to "tang.bmrb.wisc.edu"
    This is done in the settings file for the apache webserver on manatee:
    /bmrb/etc/httpd.conf
    kill apache's first by issueing stop or restart
    but then last time I did, 1/18/05 it didn't die completely
    kill -9 did stop it though.
    /etc/init.d/apache.bmrb start

* Settings:
  * To enable server side includes add to the directory section:
      XBitHack full
