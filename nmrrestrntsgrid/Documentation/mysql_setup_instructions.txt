* integration with Eclipse is thru: mysql-connector-java-5.0.3.jar
    - Make sure the data tools are installed. INstall trhu 
        Help->Software Install->new->Europa Discovery Site->data tools or something
        Add the driver from Wattos/lib. Doesn't need to match exact version of db installed..
            Test it with pinging until connection made.
        Then in Eclipse still In Data Source Explorer, new connection profile.
            select the driver and it's settings from previous steps.
        Open an SQL file like from Wattos/scripts/sql
        Connect it to db from above step.
        Highlight a text and right click select 'Execute Selected Text'
        Results will appear in tab for 'SQL Results'

In order to access the mysql db over ssh see:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/windows-and-ssh.html
worked by setting connection parameters to localhost:33061
and tunnel with securecrt with in: 33061 and out tang:3306
Then add a user localhost.localdomain
