This directory contains the input data for scoring gathered
from many different resources. All .csv files are read by the
scoring program (Wattos), the other files are intermediates.

The score??.csv files are merely place holders for the data that
will be put out by Wattos.

The manual override list is in override.csv.

The directory dtd contains the data type dictionaries in a
format for Wattos for each csv file read by Wattos.
